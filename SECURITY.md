# Security policy

Flodni is a torrent engine behind a FUSE virtual filesystem, run by its
maintainer at home. Its configuration file holds tracker and API
credentials; it holds no other personal data.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report it privately through GitHub: **Security** tab, then **Report a
vulnerability**. Please do not open a public issue. Expect an answer within
a week.

In scope: this repository's code, the container image, CI workflows and
anything that could leak a secret. Issues in the vendored
`anacrolix/torrent` are best reported to that project as well.

## Known limits

Authentication on the control server (`metrics_port`, default 9080) is
opt-in. Set `api_token` in `config.json` or `FLODNI_API_TOKEN` and every
route except the static panel page (`GET /control`) needs
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the two webhook routes also accept
`?token=<token>`, because Plex and Jellyfin cannot send headers. Unset, the
API is open: bind it to loopback or a private network, never to an address
other people can reach.

The same token also covers GoStorm's own server on port 8090 (torrent
control, settings, `/stream`, shutdown): every route except `GET /echo`, the
readiness probe, needs the `Authorization: Bearer` header, and there is no
query-token form. External clients of 8090 must send it when it is set;
flodni's own calls to the engine already do. With no token set, 8090 is open
as before, so keep it off any network others can reach. GoStorm's server
bounds header reads (10 s) and idle connections (120 s); it sets no read or
write timeout, because streams and uploads are long-lived.

Flodni does not provide TLS, so the token travels in clear text: put the
control port behind a TLS proxy on any untrusted network. The token is
compared in constant time and never logged, but there is no rate limiting or
lockout.

## Secrets

The repository holds no secrets; `config.json` is ignored by git and
`config.json.example` carries placeholders. CI runs gitleaks on the full
history, and GitHub secret scanning with push protection is enabled.
