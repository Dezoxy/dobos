// Reader budget. A file that no media server has confirmed as playing can still be read
// end to end by a scanner, a hasher or a copy. This file counts what such a reader takes
// past the head and tail windows (which the warmup cache serves anyway) and logs a
// session once when it crosses a margin (phase a, measuring).
//
// Phase b, opt-in refusal: the predicate (budgetBlocksFetch), the per-handle hold
// (budgetGate), the metrics and the log lines. handle.go asks the gate at the first cache
// miss and the predicate at its four prefetch sites; pump.go parks on the predicate. With
// refuse_unconfirmed_reads off (the default) nothing here refuses or slows a read.
//
// The Prometheus counter is what the reader took past the windows, whichever path
// served it: outside the exempt windows every such byte is swarm cost, even when it
// was filled earlier. The pump and the prefetches fill ahead of the reader. Their fills
// are attributed to the session of the file in a second tally (noteFillAttributed),
// always counted and exported; it moves the margin, and so when refusal starts, only
// with attribute_fills_to_reader on. The log line splits the served bytes by the read
// path that answered, for debugging: swarm_bytes waited for the engine (srcFetchBlock,
// which can answer from pieces it already holds), cache_bytes came from the read-ahead
// cache (srcRACacheHit). Neither is a count of bytes downloaded.
//
// Read-ahead overshoot: a miss inside the head window is never refused, and its
// read-ahead can run past the window edge into the middle. noteReadaheadOvershoot
// counts those bytes (always on); unconfirmed_readahead_clamp stops the read-ahead at
